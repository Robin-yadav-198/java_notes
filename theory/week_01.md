**❔ what is programmig language ❔**\
  *language -- language is a medium of communication between 2 entities .*\
  **programming language** - language that helps to communicate between humans and computers.

### low level language 
_Low-level language woh language hoti hai jo hardware ke bahut paas hoti hai.
Computer ko directly samajh aati hai, lekin humans ke liye difficult hoti hai._
Traditionally (in the early days), programmers used low-level languages to write programs.
- Low-level languages are very close to computer hardware.
- They are machine-dependent.
- They are difficult for humans to read and write.
- They provide very little abstraction from hardware.\

**why low level language are not optimal to use ❔**\
-->how low level language works :\
first form RAM the data is transferred to register and the alu computes on it ..the problem is register are in less number so first some data is put on register from ram then we compute acc to that data after that result is send to ram and then from lefted data register take data and compute on them .... this take much time and this process is error-prone also.  

🧠 to overcome this we need abstraction

### Abstraction:
Parts of abstraction:
1. assiging values to named variable
2. conditional execution (if else block)
3. iteration(loops)
4. Functions/procedures, recursion
5. aggregate data structure(a process that compiles and organizes large datasets into useful insights)-- list, arrays, dictionary
